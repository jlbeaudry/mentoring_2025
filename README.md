# Researcher Mentoring Program for Early Career Researchers (2025)

This file was started in 2024 when the EOIs were completed for the 2025 
program.

It contains all files necessary to clean the data from Qualtrics,
facilitate the matching process, and produce a report summarising the
participants.

It will also include the code required to analyse the two feedback surveys:

-   mid-point evaluation
-   end evaluation
