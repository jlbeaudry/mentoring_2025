# subtitle: "Data Script for Preprocessing the EOIs"
#author: "Jen Beaudry"

# This script cleans the data and gives us a quick report of how many people
  # applied from each College. 

# This info is the same as the 00_.Rmd file, but I don't know which will be needed
  # next year to run the script. Will need to play with it. 

# Ideally, I want to build this in to be run in the 02 Rmd file, but I don't have
  # time in 2025. Review this at the end of the year. 

# I think that we should be able to pull from this script so the numbers are in 
  # the reports and we don't have the same chunk in two (or three??) scripts 
  # that are identical. [check if we need to use any of this in 01 Rmd too]
  # Removes errors. 
  # one way of doing this: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/read-chunk.html

# If I can't figure out how to pull it, then I think I can do the analysis in '00_'
  # then run that in '01_' and then just count it in '02_' for the report. There's no 
  # point in running the same code repeatedly across the different files.

#### RECODE VARIABLES ####

# integer(0) means there are no duplicates
# any other number reflects a duplicate. Two or more numbers indicates two or
# more duplicates.
