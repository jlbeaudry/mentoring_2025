We received `r original_n_tor` mentor applications and `r original_n_tee` mentee
applications. We screened this data for quality and then removed people who did not meet the
eligibility criteria for the program: 

  *  Duplicates: We had `r dup_tee` mentee applications with 
  multiple entries. We removed incomplete copies of these duplicated applications.
  
  *  Withdrawals: We had `r withdraw_n_tee` 
  mentee withdraw from the program because they left the university. They withdrew 
  before matching took place. 
  
  *  Errors: We had no mentees or mentors who submitted an accidental application. 
  
  *  Mentor eligibility: All mentors who applied met the eligibility criteria. 
  
  *  Mentee eligibility: We had
  `r sum(previous_no_n_tee, employ_no_n_tee, level_no_n_tee, contract_no_n_tee, phd_no_n_tee)` mentees 
  who did not meet the eligibility criteria for the program. Specifically, we 
  had `r previous_no_n_tee` applications from mentees who previously participated in the program,
  `r employ_no_n_tee` applications from people who did not hold academic positions, 
  `r level_no_n_tee` application from someone who holds a position above Level C, and
  `r contract_no_n_tee` application from someone whose contract will end 
  before November 2024. 

  *  Missing information: We removed `r nrow(no_areas_tee)`
  mentee from the data because they did not specify the areas for growth.   

As such, we completed the matching process on the remaining complete and eligible
applications from `r total_tor` mentors and `r total_tee` mentees.
