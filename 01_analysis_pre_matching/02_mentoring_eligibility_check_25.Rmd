We received `r original_n_tor` mentor applications and `r original_n_tee` mentee
applications. We screened this data for quality and then removed people who did not meet the
eligibility criteria for the program. Below are the screening steps:

  *  Duplicates: We had `r dup_tee` mentee applications with 
  multiple entries and `r dup_tor` mentor applications with multiple entries. 
  We removed incomplete copies of these duplicated applications.
  
  *  Withdrawals: We had `r withdraw_n_tee` mentee applicant and `r withdraw_n_tor` 
  mentor applicant withdraw from the program before matching took place. 
  
  *  Mentor eligibility:  We had `r level_no_n_tor` mentors who did not meet the 
  eligibility criteria for the program. These were likely mentees who accidentally 
  completed the incorrect form. 
  
  *  Mentee eligibility: We had
  `r sum(previous_no_n_tee, employ_no_n_tee, level_no_n_tee, contract_no_n_tee, phd_no_n_tee)` mentees 
  who did not meet the eligibility criteria for the program. Specifically, we 
  had `r previous_no_n_tee` application from a mentee who previously participated in the program,
  `r employ_no_n_tee` applications from people who did not hold academic positions, 
  `r phd_no_n_tee` application from people whose PhD was conferred more than 8 years ago or not 
  yet conferred, and
  `r contract_no_n_tee` application from someone whose contracts will end before November 2025. 

  *  Missing information: We removed `r nrow(no_areas_tee)`
  mentees from the data because they did not specify the areas for growth and
  `r nrow(no_areas_tor)` mentor because they did not identify the areas in which
  they could provide mentoring. 

As such, we completed the matching process on the remaining complete and eligible
applications from `r total_tor` mentors and `r total_tee` mentees.
